# 📦 AWS S3 Static Website with Terraform  

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website on **AWS S3** using **Terraform**, with automated deployments using **GitHub Actions**.  

It sets up:  
- An S3 bucket configured for static website hosting  
- A public bucket policy (for `GET` requests)  
- Website configuration (`index.html` as entry point)  
- Upload of a sample `index.html` file  
- CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions** to auto-deploy changes  

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed  
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed & configured (`aws configure`)  
- An AWS account with permissions to create S3 resources  
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

## 📂 Project Structure
```

│── main.tf        # Terraform configuration
│── index.html     # Sample website page
│── .github/workflows/terraform.yml  # GitHub Actions pipeline
```

## ⚙️ Deployment Steps (Manual)

1. **Clone the repo & enter project directory**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd s3-static-site
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**  
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan the changes**  
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply configuration (create resources)**  
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm with `yes`.  

5. **Get the website URL**  
   After apply, Terraform outputs the S3 static website endpoint.

6. **Open in browser** 🎉  
   Navigate to the URL to see your static website live.

## 🤖 CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`) that:  
- Runs `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply` on every push to the **main** branch  
- Uses GitHub Secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`) for authentication  
- Automatically updates the S3 static website when you commit changes to `index.html` or Terraform code  

### 🔑 Setup  
1. Go to **GitHub → Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**  
2. Add these repository secrets:  
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  
   - `AWS_REGION` (example: `eu-central-1`)  
3. Push a change (like editing `index.html`) → GitHub Actions will redeploy automatically 🎉

## 🧹 Clean Up
To avoid unwanted AWS charges, destroy the resources:  
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## 📖 Notes
- State files (`terraform.tfstate*`) are auto-generated by Terraform → added to `.gitignore`.  
- This project uses a **remote backend** (S3 + DynamoDB) for safe state storage and locking.  
- No CloudFront or Route53 here → the site runs directly from the S3 website endpoint.  
- Designed for **learning/demo purposes** — in production, prefer CloudFront + HTTPS.

# 📦 AWS S3 Static Website with Terraform  

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website on **AWS S3** using **Terraform**.  
It sets up:  
- An S3 bucket configured for static website hosting  
- A public bucket policy (for `GET` requests)  
- Website configuration (`index.html` as entry point)  
- Upload of a sample `index.html` file  

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed  
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed & configured (`aws configure`)  
- An AWS account with permissions to create S3 resources

## 📂 Project Structure
```
s3-static-site/
│── main.tf        # Terraform configuration
│── index.html     # Sample website page
```

## ⚙️ Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repo & enter project directory**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd s3-static-site
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**  
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan the changes**  
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply configuration (create resources)**  
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm with `yes`.  

5. **Get the website URL**  
   After apply, Terraform outputs the S3 static website endpoint.

6. **Open in browser** 🎉  
   Navigate to the URL to see your static website live.

## 🧹 Clean Up
To avoid unwanted AWS charges, destroy the resources:  
```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

## 📖 Notes
- State files (`terraform.tfstate*`) are auto-generated by Terraform → add them to `.gitignore`.  
- No CloudFront or Route53 here → the site runs directly from the S3 website endpoint.  
- Designed for **learning/demo purposes** — in production, prefer CloudFront + HTTPS.
